                What is a healthy soil? Across time and cultures, soil health has often been used as a barometer for societal health.
                The now predictable argument is that if civilizations do not tend to the health and fertility of their own soil, they
                will eventually fall. The geologist David Montgomery’s book, <a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Dirt: The Erosion of Civilizations</i></a>
                tracks this argument from Mesopotamia to the present while also providing a history of how  scientists have come to
                understand the importance of soil as the “skin of the earth”. And yet, the question remains: what is a healthy soil, who
                gets to decide such things in any given place and time and what measures of coercion or freedom are taken to cultivate “healthy”
                soil? We might look back and in retrospect see what was considered healthy was actually harming. Thus, health is a historically
                and culturally constructed judgement of soil that is never without debate. This unit aims to construct a more nuanced conversation
                about how human health and soil health have been intertwined at different historical moments. We argue that societies have defined
                and intervened in soil health in a variety of ways and that we are now living out the legacies of these various definitions. The
                unit starts by considering how we evaluate soil, building on some of the readings and exercises from <a href="/units/1-soil-as-substrate">Unit 1</a>. We then
                look at how humans intervene to change soil health, and how soil health changes human health. The final day considers how soil is often seen as a
                reflection not just of individual bodies, but of the body politic, mirroring some of the topics discussed in the fourth and final unit
                on soil and belonging.

                    People in a variety of historical and social contexts have developed different judgments and methods to understand
                    what a healthy or good soil might be. Often, it is only after soil becomes infertile that communities are left
                    to grapple with how the value of the soil relates to one’s own well being as well as the quality of other
                    life forms or products. Today’s activities and readings will consider how people determine and intervene
                    in soil when it mostly shows up as dust, revealing histories of erosion or pollution. How do people and
                    communities deal with dust when they deem it unhealthy and unruly, and how have these assessments
                    changed over time?

                    The Dust Bowl was a series of dust storms, which destroyed farmlands in the Great Plains throughout the 1930s.
                    It is often considered the worst man-made ecological disaster in American history.

                    Soil conservationists of the 1930s and 1940s were deeply concerned with the problem of soil erosion, particularly
                    in colonial contexts. Much of their research was dedicated to historicizing global processes of desertification
                    during periods in which European powers were attempting to strengthen their hold onto arid and semi-arid territories.

                <p class="large">
                    Caring for soil is a practice contingent on the diverse ways in which people relate to land. Care for soil is
                    related to care for bodies, about practices that variously connect humans to “tradition” or “modernity”. These
                    interventions can draw on or erase historical relations to the soil as well as determine futures. When things
                    fail – financially, ecologically – this can provoke changing regimes of care. In some cases this leads to
                    quick fix solutions such as the use of agrochemicals to revitalize the dying land. In other cases, this has
                    been a call to abandon agrochemicals and “return” to older traditions of stewarding soil.  Caring for soil
                    therefore ranges from composting to applying toxins, all forms being the reflection of a relationship an
                    individual or community has with soil as well as the capitalist pressures facing these actors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, farmers in Pare, Tanzania use pesticides and agrochemicals to treat infertile soil in the rice
                    farms while natural manure is used outside the project for ginger farming. The demands of the crops and the
                    history of those crops command different ways of caring for the soil as well as for the crops, and thus different
                    relationships between different farmers and soil emerge.
