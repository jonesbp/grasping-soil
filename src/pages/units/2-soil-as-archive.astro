                This unit builds on the previous unit’s exploration of soil’s ability to hold and reflect historical metabolisms
                to consider its role in holding, reflecting, or obscuring history more broadly. We ask the following questions
                to frame this unit’s activities and readings:

                    How can we envision soil as an archive—what does this help us see? What silences are embedded in
                    this archive?
                </li>
                <li>
                    How have soil archives been created and used and in the service of what projects?  What erasures are
                    embedded in this process?
                </li>
                <li>
                    How can we reimagine soil as an archive—one that materializes the lasting legacies of imperial histories
                    and racialized social relations?
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Understanding the way that social and historical processes manifest materially in the soil can both help us
                understand how we live with the legacies of past and ongoing processes, but also to take control of the
                archive—to better understand what those legacies are and how we might reshape them.

                    them and try to describe the features you are comparing. What do the layers look like? If you don’t see any
                    layers, add dish detergent and shake it up, then wait for the sediments to fall. Look at the ratio of different
                    layers: soil, silt, sand, clay.

                    Some archives are about soil, and intentionally index soil within archival frameworks. Some archives
                    go to elaborate lengths to remove soil–we might say, following Michel-Rolph Trouillot, to silence soil–and
                    we can see an example of this in the modern herbarium. Plant collectors laboriously disentangle plants
                    from soil, using chemical washes and dehydrators in order to mount plants flat on a piece of paper.
                    These herbarium sheets are then archived and organized according to evolutionary relationships. Soil
                    information is very rarely included, except for in one herbarium, which is called the
                    “<a href="https://tischlibrary.tufts.edu/special-collections-badianus-manuscript" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Codex Badiano</a>.”
                    This is the oldest extant medicinal text in the Americas, and its illustrations of plants always include
                    roots and soil. Clearly, its authors thought that soil was an important part of how plants should be
                    described. In this lesson, we will consider what the silencing of soil in botanical archives has meant
                    historically, and what it might teach us about the metaphysics of our contemporary empirical practices.

                <h3>Activity:</h3>
                <p class="large">
                    Let’s follow Michel-Rolph Trouillot’s four moments through the botanical garden to examine the silences that may or may not be produced.
                </p>

                <h4>Step 1</h4>
                <p>
                    Trouillot’s first moment is the moment a plant is collected. In this moment, the plant is pulled out of
                    the ground, meticulously disentangled from the soil, and made into a "type." Before the plant was pulled
                    from the ground it was just another plant in a world full of plants, but in the moment it is "collected"
                    it begins to stand in for the species in general. It is no longer specific to that piece of ground, to
                    that soil, or to its relationship with sun and shade in the place it grew. It is now a specimen. Let's
                    examine this moment of fact creation in the Missouri Botanical Garden archive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Go to the Missouri Botanical Garden archival database:<br />
                    <a href="https://livingcollections.org/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://livingcollections.org/home</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Find a plant in the Missouri Botanic Garden (any plant) that you would like to explore. For example,
                    try searching: "Fraxinus americana."
                </p>
                <p>
                    To find Trouillot’s 1st moment for this plant, go to one of the plant's herbarium sheets and look at it
                    closely. Who collected this plant? What was their name? Where did they collect it? Next, explore the links
                    associated with the plant. How many different ways has this plant (and plant species) been entered into
                    this database? As you explore the archive, you are now exploring Trouillot’s second moment: the moment
                    where the collected plant becomes part of a larger archive.
                </p>

                <h4>Step 2</h4>
                <p>
                    Trouillot’s third moment is when we start to do things with the archive. This is when narratives are
                    constructed through the ability to retrieve information that the archive has made available to our thinking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Directly next to the species name (maybe Fraxinus americana) of your plant in the Living Collections
                    Management System there will be a small Missouri Botanical Garden Logo. Click on this small logo.
                    This will take you to Tropicos, the MOBOT taxonomic database. What can you learn about the plant here?
                    Does the plant have an "author"? Who is this person? What other plants did they identify?
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the case of Fraxinus americana, the author is Linneaus himself, meaning that Linnaeus was the first
                    one to name this species. You'll also find citation information for the text in which the species first
                    appeared in writing. In this case, Tropicos tells us that Fraxinus americana was first identified by
                    Linneaus in the book Species Plantarum (1753). Next to this citation you'll see some more small logos...
                    one of them has the letters "BHL." Click on this link, which will take you to the Biodiversity Heritage
                    Library site: <a href="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here, you will see a digital scan of the physical book from 1753 where Fraxinus americana first appeared.
                </p>

                <h4>Step 3</h4>
                <p>
                    Trouillot’s final step is the making of history. This is where many narratives are considered and analyzed
                    in order to construct an account of the past. In this case, the plant was collected in 1941 by Jonathan
                    Wright as part of a collection he called "Plants of Indian Territory." Could we think of this plant's
                    history as exclusively taxonomic, or might think of the legacy of settler colonialism as an important
                    dimension of this plant's "territory?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the final step, you will research and write your own history of this plant. Consider what aspects of
                    this plant's history may have been left out of its presentation in the herbarium—for instance, more
                    about the person who collected it and the circumstances under which they did so; or alternative contexts
                    in which that plant may have gained meaning (e.g. within Indigenous knowledge systems). Drawing on this
                    research, write a blurb for this plant that “includes the soil”—that is, situates it within a  political,
                    historical, ecological, and social context.
                </p>
