                Soil underlies human activity and society in the very physical and biological sense. Itâ€™s the literal foundation
                for any kind of be(long)ing, because the cultivation of land feeds our bodies. However, human attachment to soil often
                includes a series of abstractions, transforming soils from a physical substrate into ownership (like property in land),
                or place (homeland, locality). Both senses relate to the words belong and belonging, which come from older Dutch
                and German words for demand, obtain, reach for, and long for. What is the circular feedback between the conception of
                land as an object of belonging and soil as a container and enabler of life? How do we grapple with the differences
                or similarities between feeling tied to a particular place on earth and a political project that aims to tie
                belonging to the soil through a rhetoric of blood, purity, and ultimately violence?
