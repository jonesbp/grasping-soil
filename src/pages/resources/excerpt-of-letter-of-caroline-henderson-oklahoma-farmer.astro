                Your continued interest in our effort to 'tie a knot in the end of the rope and hang on' is most stimulating. Our
                recent transition from rain-soaked eastern Kansas with its green pastures, luxuriant foliage, abundance of flowers,
                and promise of a generous harvest, to the dust-covered desolation of No Man's Land was a difficult change to crowd
                into one short day's travel. Eleanor has laid aside the medical books for a time. Wearing our shade hats, with
                handkerchiefs tied over our faces and Vaseline in our nostrils, we have been trying to rescue our home from the
                accumulations of wind-blown dust which penetrates wherever air can go. It is an almost hopeless task, for there
                is rarely a day when at some time the dust clouds do not roll over. 'Visibility' approaches zero and everything
                is covered again with a silt-like deposit which may vary in depth from a film to actual ripples on the kitchen
                floor. I keep oiled cloths on the window sills and between the upper and lower sashes. They help just a little to
                retard or collect the dust. Some seal the windows with the gummed-paper strips used in wrapping parcels, but no
                method is fully effective. We buy what appears to be red cedar sawdust with oil added to use in sweeping our floors,
                and do our best to avoid inhaling the irritating dust.

            <p>
                In telling you of these conditions I realize that I expose myself to charges of disloyalty to this western region. A
                good Kansas friend suggests that we should imitate the Californian attitude toward earthquakes and keep to ourselves
                what we know about dust storms. Since the very limited rains of May in this section gave some slight ground for
                renewed hope, optimism has been the approved policy. Printed articles or statements by journalists, railroad
                officials, and secretaries of small-town Chambers of Commerce have heralded too enthusiastically the return of
                prosperity to the drought region. And in our part of the country that is the one durable basis for any prosperity whatever.
                There is nothing else to build upon. But you wished to know the truth, so I am telling you the actual situation,
                though I freely admit that the facts are themselves often contradictory and confusing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Early in May, with no more grass or even weeds on our 640 acres than on your kitchen floor, and even the scanty
                remnants of dried grasses from last year cut off and blown away, we decided, like most of our neighbors, to ship
                our cattle to grass in the central part of the state. We sent 27 head, retaining here the heifers coming fresh
                this spring. The shipping charge on our part of the carload was $46. Pasture costs us $7.00 for a cow and calf for
                the season and $5.00 for a yearling. Whether this venture brings profit or loss depends on whether the cattle
                make satisfactory gains during the summer and whether prices remain reasonable or fall back to the level that most
                people would desire. We farmers here in the United States might as well recognize that we are a minority group, and
                that the prevailing interest of the nation as a whole is no longer agricultural. Hay for the horses and the heifers
                remaining here cost us $3 per ton, brought by truck from eastern Oklahoma.
            </p>
            <p>
                The day after we shipped the cattle, the long drought was temporarily broken by the first effective moisture in many
                months—about one and one-quarter inches in two or three gentle rains. All hope of a wheat crop had been abandoned
                by March or April.
            </p>
            <p>
                Contrary to many published reports, a good many people had left this country either temporarily or permanently before
                any rains came. And they were not merely 'drifters,' as is frequently alleged. In May a friend in the southwestern
                county of Kansas voluntarily sent me a list of the people who had already left their immediate neighborhood or were packed
                up and ready to go. The list included 109 persons in 26 families, substantial people, most of whom had been in that locality
                over ten years, and some as long as forty years. In these families there had been two deaths from dust pneumonia. Others
                in the neighborhood were ill at that time. Fewer actual residents have left our neighborhood, but on a sixty
                mile trip yesterday to procure tract repairs we saw many pitiful reminder of broken hopes and apparently wasted effort.
                Little abandoned homes where people had drilled deep wells for the precious water, had set trees and vines built
                reservoirs, and fenced in gardens —with everything now walled in half buried by banks of drifted soil, — told a
                painful story of loss and disappointment. I grieved especially over one lonely plum thicket buried to the tips
                of the twigs, and a garden with fence closely built of boards for wit protection, now enclosing only a hillock
                of dust covered with the blue-flower bull nettles which no winds or sands discourage….
            </p>
            <p>
                …. Naturally you will wonder why we stay where conditions are so extremely disheartening. Why not pick up and
                leave as so many others have done? It is a fair question, but a hard one to answer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recently I talked with a young university graduate of very superior attainments. He took the ground that in such a ease
                sentiment could and should be disregarded. He may be right. Yet I cannot act or feel or think as if the experiences of our
                twenty-seven years of life together had never been. And they are all bound up with the little corner to which we
                have given our continued and united efforts. To leave voluntarily to break all these closely knit ties for the sake of a
                possibly greater comfort elsewhere—seems like defaulting on our task. We may have to leave. We can't hold out
                indefinitely without some return from the land, some source of income, however small. But I think I can never
                go willingly or without pain that as yet seems unendurable.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are also practical considerations that serve to hold us here, for the present. Our soil is excellent. We need
                only a little rain—less than in most places—to make it productive. No one who remembers the wheat crops of 1926,
                1929, 1931, can possibly regard this as permanently submarginal land. The newer methods of farming suggest possibilities
                of better control of moisture in the future. Our entire equipment is adapted to the type of farming suitable for
                this country and would have to be replaced at great expense with the tools needed in some other locality. We have
                spent so much in trying to keep our land from blowing away that it looks foolish to walk off and leave it, when
                somewhat more favorable conditions seem now to 'cast their shadows before.' I scarcely need to tell you that
                there is no use in thinking of either renting or selling farm property here at present. It is just a place to stand
                on—if we can keep the taxes paid—and work and hope for a better day. We could realize nothing whatever from
                all our years of struggle with which to make a fresh start.
            </p>
            <p>
                We long for the garden and little chickens, the trees and birds and wild flowers of the years gone by. Perhaps if
                we do our part these good things may return some day, for others if not for ourselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                Will joins me in earnest hopes for your recovery. The dust has been particularly aggravating to his bronchial trouble,
                but he keeps working on. A great reddish-brown dust cloud is rising now from the southeast, so we must get
                out and do our night work before it arrives. Our thoughts go with you.
